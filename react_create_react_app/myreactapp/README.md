# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Common commands used with npm (Node Package Manager) in the context of React develop- ment:
1. npm init
2. npm install react: Installs the React library.or npm i react
3. npm install react-dom: Installs the React-DOM library, which is used for rendering React components in the DOM.

Package.json
Package.json serves as the blueprint for our project.
It includes important information about your project, such as its name, version, and dependencies.

Dependencies (inside package.json)
Dependencies in package.json indicate that your code execution and functionality depend on specific libraries or packages.

Node modules are directories containing all the modules and dependencies required for your project.

you also need bundler for your project
why?
– Enabling live reloading, so any changes you make are immediately reflected in your applica- tion.
– Handling tasks such as image optimization to optimize the performance of your app.
– Running your code during development.
– Minifying your code for production to improve performance.

example of bundlers are: parcel, webpack
here we have installed parcel bundler
1. npm i parcel

now to execute we use npx command
1. NPM (Node Package Manager) is used for installing packages and managing project dependen- cies.
2. NPX is a package runner tool that comes with npm. It is used for executing packages or commands.

command will be for this project:
1. npx parcel index.html

and server will be running at http://localhost:1234 (by default).
